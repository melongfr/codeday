        ðŸš¨ Breaking News: CodeDay Delhi is happening on 28-29 September 2024!
    </div>

    <h1>CodeDay Delhi 2024: A Must-Attend Event for Aspiring Developers</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2My Experience</h2>
        <p>
            CodeDay, the popular student-focused hackathon and coding event, is making a big splash in Delhi on 28-29 September 2024. The event, which encourages young developers to collaborate and create innovative software projects, is set to take place over 24 hours, gathering aspiring coders from schools and colleges across the region.
        </p>

        <h2>The Event </h2>
        <p>
            CodeDay is not your usual tech event; it brings together both new and seasoned coders to create, build, and present projects. The atmosphere is so inviting that even if you're brand new to coding, you'll feel encouraged to get right in. The mentors and volunteers were really helpful and willing to assist us anytime we got stuck, which was especially soothing for those who were coding for the first time.
        </p>

        <h2>My Project</h2>
        <p>
            Me and My Partners with varying degrees of expertise and I formed a duo. Our objective was to develop an app that uses gamification to increase learning's level of interaction. We collaborated as a team to overcome many challenges as we developed concepts, produced code, and encountered several roadblocks. Watching our ideas come to life was thrilling, and it was really satisfying to see our product completed and operational at the conclusion of the event.
